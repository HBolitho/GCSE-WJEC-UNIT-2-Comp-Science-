Yes - This is my project and my method about completing the set tasks however if you wish to improve or change feel free.

Yes

#### Question 3 - Is there any encryption or code to prevent hacks etc?

No  - You will have to add the enryption and security of the database on your own. Since security wasn't apart of the brief I didn't add anything additional - This might change in the future.
